Assume variable "A" holds 10, & variable "B" holds 20.


// 1) + (Add) ... A + B = 30

The "+" is used to combine the numbers (with their values) togehter.

// 2) - (Subtract) ... A - B = -10

The "-" is used to take a number, and decrease (minus) it with another number to obtain a new value.

// 3) * (Multiply) ... A * B = 200

(*)The "*" is used to duplicate one number by the amount of another; i.e. 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 200, "Ten 20s added together make 200."

// 4) / (Divide) ... B / A = 2

The / splits the "numerator by the de-numerator". i.e. 10 can go into 20, 2 times.

// 5) ++ (Increment) ... A++ = 11 OR B++ = 21

// 6) -- (Decrement) ... A-- = 9 OR B-- = 19

// 7) = (Assignment) ... C = A + B; The value of A + B is "assigned" to the value of C.

// 8) == (Equality Check) ... A == B are not equal, therefore, it is not true.

// 9) > (Greater Than) ... A > B is false, 10 is not greater than 20.

// 10) < (Less Than) ... A < B is true, 10 is less than 20.

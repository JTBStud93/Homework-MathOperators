Assume variable "A" holds 10, & variable "B" holds 20.


// 1) + (Add) ... A + B = 30

// 2) - (Subtract) ... A - B = -10

// 3) * (Multiply) ... A * B = 200

// 4) / (Divide) ... B / A = 2

// 5) ++ (Increment) ... A++ = 11 OR B++ = 21

// 6) -- (Decrement) ... A-- = 9 OR B-- = 19

// 7) = (Assignment) ... C = A + B; The value of A + B is "assigned" to the value of C.

// 8) == (Equality Check) ... A == B are not equal, therefore, it is not true.

// 9) > (Greater Than) ... A > B is false, 10 is not greater than 20.

// 10) < (Less Than) ... A < B is true, 10 is less than 20.
